A simple code I wrote that started off as way for me to learn about arrays.

Its a data management "app" that manages a list of your dream cars.

I incorporated a database that stores your inputs so that the code acts as a functional app.

You can add or delete data, in this case car names, or you can choose to simply display(show) the data that has been stored.

I used a while loop to keep the code running so you can continuously add/delete things as you please, you can end the program by typing "exit" when prompted.

In the future I would like to make it GUI based so you can click buttons instead of typing things,
and i would like to add an API that displays info on cars of your choice when prompted to help you determine if you would like to add saidcar to your list of dream cars.
